# Welcome

This repository is for www.alexanderfarrell.com. It hosts various projects, such as information on *Programming Courses by Alexander Farrell*, and *Programming Tutorials by Alexander Farrell*.

## Folders

Folders in the root (see above) are set up as follows:

Folder|Description
------|------
data | Code for the database, mostly written in SQL
docs | A place for documents and information on the project (under construction)
public | The frontend - Where JavaScript files, CSS Stylesheets, Images, etc. are hosted for the web page
server | The backend - Where server code exists run by the server

_It's worth noting that HTML files are instead included in **server / views** as **templates**. And are EJS files rather than HTML files._

## Files

Files in the root (see above) are set up as follows:

File | Description 
-----|---------
package.json | The file which describes the project, including other code it is dependent on.
tsconfig.json | The instructions for transpiling (converting) TypeScript into JavaScript
readme.md | This file you are reading! Written in Markdown (MD file)

## Goals
