# Welcome

This repository is for www.alexanderfarrell.com. It hosts various projects, such as information on *Programming Courses by Alexander Farrell*, and *Programming Tutorials by Alexander Farrell*. 

## Purpose of This Repository

You may be coming from www.alexanderfarrell.com. This website hosts the public code for the website for educational and improvement purposes. 

You are welcome to view the code. It is continually updated, and may change over time.

## Navigation

Folders and files in the root (see above) are set up as follows:

Folder|Description
------|------
data | Code for the database, mostly written in SQL
docs | A place for documents and information on the project (under construction)
public | The frontend - Where JavaScript files, CSS Stylesheets, Images, etc. are hosted for the web page
server | The backend - Where server code exists run by the server
package.json | The file which describes the project, including other code it is dependent on.
tsconfig.json | The instructions for transpiling (converting) TypeScript into JavaScript
readme.md | This file you are reading! Written in Markdown (MD file)

It's worth noting that HTML files are instead included in _**server / views**_ as **templates**. And are EJS files rather than HTML files.
