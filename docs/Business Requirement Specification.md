## Product

The Website features four main kinds of projects:

1. Programming Courses
2. Programming Tutorials
3. Apps & Games
4. Articles

### Programming Courses

Programming courses give people one-on-one lessons in software creation over video conferencing. It teaches people more affordably, powerfully and individually how to build software products.  

It is designed to be a more affordable, powerfully effective and highly adaptable product. It seeks to make getting help in a wide variety of topics easy and accessible to customers, as well as more affordable.

Many people find code intimidating. The internet has so many resources available, yet its difficult for people to know where to start. Other options can also be very expensive, and take students through generic instruction. With the Programming Courses Project, the goal is to instead make it more affordable, effective and adaptable to help more people gain specific skills. 

While the Courses cannot offer every piece of knowledge, or help in every project, it seeks to expand to do so more and more. It offers lessons currently in the following technologies, though it is not limited to this list:

- Python 3
- Pandas
- JavaScript & TypeScript
- HTML 5
- CSS & Sass
- PostgreSQL
- NodeJS & Express
- Git
- Heroku
- C#
- Unity
- Java

### Programming Tutorials

Programming Tutorials help cover topics in building software simply, powerfully, conceptually and for free. 

While Programming Courses can help with one-on-one instruction, making concepts accessible to learners will help achieve the goals of The Website more efficiently. 

Why should someone schedule a course when a tutorial on variables might be just as effective? The Courses are best for teaching in an adaptive way; to help each individual in their own unique journey. A one-on-one teacher can help answer specific questions, help the student reach specific goals, help them master what is more to their interest, etc. For everything else, having a free set of Tutorials will do great service to The Website, the teachers and the customers.

Programming Tutorials helps enhance the quality of Programming Courses. It gives material to go over if needed or curious. It provides material the student can review. It makes programming knowledge more accessible. Even if we help someone for free, the needs of the customer will have been met.

### Apps & Games

Apps & Games will provide examples to students of software products, many or all of which the code will be available to view, and which may provide other usefulness as well.

Who am I to teach how to build software products without doing so myself? Apps & Games is a powerful way to help individuals see how everything comes together to make a software product. It can also be a springboard to other products which the Website might offer in the future.

### Publications

Publications will provide a framework and a place to host articles. It will integrate with Programming Tutorials, but be more general purpose. This will allow material to expand about or beyond coding to increase the reach of The Website, as well as explore other kinds of products.

## Development

The Website will be developed iteratively. It is a collection of smaller projects which can be rapidly refined to meet this goal. 

## Finding

### Marketing

Marketing occurs indirectly via ads in places where those looking to learn how to code might be. 

There is a two phase process:

1. Ads in the beginning are more short term. They will focus on people looking to learn at the moment.
2. Ads later will be more long-term once volume has increased and The Website helps more people. It will seek to be more widespread in awareness of The Website to increase accessibility further.

### Sales

Sales will be adaptable to each customer. Programming Courses should provide good value to customers. I want to sell courses when the courses will provide value to the customer. As in make the experience of learning programming faster. Or being able to answer questions. Or get help with projects. Or make it easier to learn. 

As such, sales is contextual. Otherwise, we can direct individuals to free Programming Tutorials hosted here which may benefit them equally for free.

## Finance

The Website will create financial plans once a month, with key indicators determined in such a month.
