The website should be about other people. I realize when implementing an art section of the website, that it's somewhat self-serving. 

That wasn't my intention, but I really should create art which helps others. Which brings beauty to the world, or which provides value to others.

So with that being said, I must explore ways to revise the art section.

I've thought a lot about other sections of the website. What is the goal of the website? It perhaps is that I want to help others accomplish their goals, and gain knowledge in subjects if I can help them.
