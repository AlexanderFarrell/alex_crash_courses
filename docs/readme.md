# Docs

Software projects need to be planned. Not all aspects of this project are code, per se. 

This folder contains documents on the purpose of this work, purpose of this website, and description of its design.

I am not providing business, financial, legal or accounting advise.

## Files

File | Description
-----|-------
[Business Requirement Specification.md](./Business%20Requirement%20Specification.md) | What needs do we seek to solve? What resources are there? How may we find solutions to needs?
[Software Requirement Specification.md](./Software%20Requirement%20Specification.md) | What must the software do? What is its purpose? (under construction)
[Software Design Document.md](./Software%20Design%20Document.md) | How is the software to be built? How do we implement solutions to the requirements? (under construction)

### These Are Available Publicly?

Absolutely. While sensitive or specific data may not be, I wish to share the purpose, expectations and design of this product publicly. This is for two reasons:

1. To provide an example of why and how the Website has come about.
2. To further the discussion on all 3 of these kinds of documents.
3. For public critique and improvement (which one may email at [info@alexanderfarrell.com](mailto:info@alexanderfarrell.com)).

### Why are they structured differently than other SRSs or SDDs?

There are standard ways for how these documents may be structured. For more rich knowledge authoring a BRS, SRS or SDD, other sources can be extremely helpful. 

These documents are extremely helpful when building or revising the Website. For simplicity, they are much smaller than the average BRS, SRS or SDD. This also allows some flexibility, though with still various constraints to meet the end goal.
